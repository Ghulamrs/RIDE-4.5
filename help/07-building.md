# 7. Building

## Two commands, and neither guesses which you meant

**`Ctrl-B` compiles the file in the edit view; `F5` runs it.** Neither asks the
project anything. A project does not have to be open, does not have to be shut,
and does not have to hold the file — open something from anywhere and `Ctrl-B`
compiles that. This is the fix-one, build-again rhythm the editor is built
around.

**`F4` builds the project; `Build ▸ Run project` builds and runs it.** These
read the file list and never the edit view. What they build is what `"build"`
says.

Which one you meant is said by which one you pressed. There is nothing here
that has to be guessed at.

## What a build shows you

The Console tab gets the command and everything the compiler said. A build of
several groups says each one as it starts:

```
$ c90, clang++ and cpp11 3 sources -o three
    src/main.c
    src/legacy.c
    engine/engine.cpp
$ Sources (c90)
$ Legacy (clang++)
$ Engine (cpp11)
$ linking with clang++
[built /home/you/three/three]
```

`Sources` and `Engine` named nothing: C went to c90 and C++ to cpp11, which is
where each goes on its own. `Legacy` is a group of C that asked for the
host's C++ compiler by name. The link is the host's, since cpp11's objects
want the C++ runtime the machine has.

**An error in a file nothing has opened opens it.** c90 stops at the first one,
and in a build of six files that is usually not the file you were looking at,
so the editor opens the one it named before putting the caret on the line and
column. With several groups the diagnostic is looked for among *that group's*
sources, so the caret lands in the file the compiler was complaining about
rather than in whichever file the target happened to list first.

## Targets

`Ctrl-T` moves to the next target; the Target menu names all three.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `x86_64-windows` | MASM, assembled by `ml64` |
| `x86_64-linux` | GNU assembly |
| `arm64-darwin` | this Mac's own |

**Only the host's own target reaches a program.** c90, cpp11 and shalimar generate
for all three, but the assembler and linker they hand off to are this machine's, so a
cross target stops at the assembly — which is shown in the Assembly tab. The
editor says so rather than failing obscurely.

`cl`, `clang++` and `g++` take no target from this editor at all: they generate
for the machine they were installed on, so what they build is what this machine
runs whatever the Target menu says.

## Debug and release

`Ctrl-D` toggles between them. What each compiler actually does about it
differs, and the editor says which rather than pretending they are the same:

| | debug | release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cl` | `/Od /Zi /D_DEBUG /MTd` | `/O2 /DNDEBUG /MT` |
| `clang++`, `g++` | `-g -D_DEBUG=1` | `-O2 -DNDEBUG=1` |
| `c90`, `cpp11` | `-g -D_DEBUG=1`, and the define alone where there is no line table | `-O2 -DNDEBUG=1` |
| `shalimar` | `--debug` | nothing |

These are the defaults; **Project ▸ Compiler Options** changes them per
configuration. c90 optimises the x86-64 targets only, and its `-O2` is its
`-O1` today. cpp11 optimises every target: on tms6747 `-O1` keeps locals in
registers, schedules execute packets and fills delay slots, and `-O2` adds
software pipelining, loop-invariant hoisting and inlining. The status bar names
a toolchain that has no `-O` when you switch, rather than letting you believe
otherwise.

**`shalimar --debug` does not change the code.** The assembly is byte-identical
between the two; what changes is which runtime archive is linked, and only the
debug one has any code in it for stopping the program.

## More than one compiler in one program

Where a target's groups do not all go to the same compiler, each group compiles
to objects and the editor links them itself — because no compiler here takes an
object as an input. Hand c90 a `.o` and it reads it as C.

The objects go in a directory of the editor's own and are removed with it,
whether the link worked or not. What survives is the program.

On Windows the linker is `link` with the C runtime named, because c90's objects
carry no `/DEFAULTLIB` directive to say which one; `cl` is given `/MT` there to
match. Everywhere else it is the same host driver c90 hands its own linking to.
