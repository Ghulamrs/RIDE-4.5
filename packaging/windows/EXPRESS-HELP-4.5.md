# RIDE 4.5 — Express Help

Three languages, four targets, one editor - and, since 4.0, the project's own
assemblers for both machines. This is the quick reference; the full pages are
under `help\`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Languages, versions and scope

| Language | Files        | Compiler  | Standard / version      | Debug info      |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| C        | `.c` `.h`    | `c90`    | ISO C 90                | DWARF (2 of 4)  |
| C++      | `.cpp` `.hpp`| `cpp11`   | ISO C++ 11              | DWARF (2 of 4)  |
| Shalimar | `.shl`       | `shalimar`    | Shalimar 1.2            | none, by design |

The suffix picks the language; **Language** menu overrides it for a file whose
name says otherwise. Each compiler announces itself at the start of a compile
(e.g. `©2026 G. R. Akhtar - ISO C++ 11`).

**The four targets** (Target menu, or Ctrl-T to cycle):

| Target            | Runs here?                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `x86_64-windows`  | yes, on this machine (host)       |
| `x86_64-linux`    | assembly only (`-S`) on Windows   |
| `arm64-darwin`    | assembly only (`-S`) on Windows   |
| `tms6747`         | yes, on the **vm6747 emulator**   |

Scope of a compiler: `c90` compiles C only (a `.cpp` is refused with a message,
not a cryptic error); `cpp11` compiles C++ only (a `.c` is refused); `shalimar`
compiles Shalimar only. The host compiler (`cl`) is still reachable per group.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Making and updating a project

All on the **Project** menu:

- **New…** — pick a folder and a name; writes `<name>.pro` and opens it.
- **New File** (Ctrl-N) — names a new file, creates it, adds it to the project.
- **Add File** — adds the file in front of you to a group you name.
- **Remove File** — takes the open file out of the project (leaves it on disk).
- **Save** — writes the `.pro` back. (New/Add/Remove save it for you.)

The title bar shows where you are: `RIDE 4.5 - <project> - <file>`. The
top-right of the menu bar shows the compiler in use (a `*` means the file chose
it). Every add and remove is reflected immediately in the `.pro` file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. The project file (`.pro`) architecture

A `.pro` is one JSON object:

    {
      "name": "demo",
      "toolchain": "auto",           // auto | c90 | cpp11 | shalimar | msvc
      "arch": "x86_64-windows",      // one of the four targets
      "indent": 4,
      "groups": {
        "Sources": ["greet.c", "main.c"],
        "Headers": ["greet.h"]
      },
      "build": { "target": "demo", "groups": ["Sources"] }
    }

- **groups** name the files, in headings shown in the left pane. A group may
  set its own `"toolchain"`.
- **build** names the program (`target`) and which groups compile into it;
  headers and un-named groups are passed over. A group holding C *and* C++ is
  split — the C to `c90`, the C++ to `cpp11` — and the objects are linked.
- Say no `build` and nothing is built (Ctrl-B still compiles the open file).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Compiling, and building/running a project

- **Ctrl-B** — compile the file in front of you.
- **F5** — compile and run that file.
- **F4** — build the project's program (from `build`).
- **Run project** (Build menu) — build it and run it.
- **Ctrl-T** / **Target** — choose the target; **Ctrl-D** — debug/release.
- The bottom panel has **Console**, **Debug** and **Assembly** (Ctrl-1/2/3).
  The Assembly tab shows the compiler's output for any target.

**tms6747:** F5 / Run project builds with `-S` and runs on the **vm6747**
emulator (`counted to three`, `[program returned 3]`). Foreign targets
(`x86_64-linux`, `arm64-darwin`) reach assembly only and say so.

**Real C674x silicon (.out / .hex):** the emulator is enough to run and test.
To produce a genuine linked `.out` and Intel `.hex`, use:

    bin\ti\ti-build.cmd  <program.c|.cpp|.shl>

It uses a Texas Instruments Code Generation Tools install already on the
machine (none of TI's tools ship here); see `bin\ti\TI-BUILD.txt`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5. The toolchain behind a build (new in 4.0)

Everything that turns your source into a program is this project's own code,
except the two links - for now:

| Step          | x86_64-windows                        | tms6747                              |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| compile       | `c90` / `cpp11` / `shalimar` (ours)      | `c90` / `cpp11` / `shalimar` (ours)     |
| assemble      | **`masm`** (ours, in place of ml64)   | **`asm6x`** (ours, in place of TI's) |
| link          | **`link`** (ours; a failure asks for link.exe) | **`lnk6x`** (ours; a failure asks for TI's) |
| run           | this machine                          | **`vm6747`** (ours), or real silicon |

`settings.json` names `masm` as the assembler for x86_64-windows out of the
box (`"assembler": "bin/masm.exe"`, relative to that file). Tools > Assembler
for x86_64-windows... changes it, or clears it to go back to ml64; `masm` also
answers ml64's own command line (`masm /nologo /c /Fo x.obj x.asm`), so a
script that ran ml64 can run it instead. The two linkers are named the same
way - `"linker": "bin/link.exe"` (LINK, held to Microsoft's byte for byte on
its probe bed) and `"tilinker": "bin/lnk6x.exe"` (LNK6x, held to TI's) - so
the project's own tools are the tools by default. When one of them fails a
build and the compilers found no fault in the source, RIDE asks: *"The
project's own masm and link did not build it. Use Visual Studio's ml64 and
link.exe for this build instead?"* (or TI's lnk6x). **Yes** builds again
through the vendor's tools, which RIDE finds itself - Visual Studio through
vswhere, TI's lnk6x under the directory Tools names; nothing has to be on
PATH. `"askNative": false` in settings.json never asks and lets the build
fail. Today the question comes up on every real link: neither linker yet
takes its vendor's runtime (Microsoft's C runtime on one side, TI's archive
and cinit on the other); each says so and stops rather than guess.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Where things are

    bin\      the editor (RIDE.exe), the console editor, the compilers
              c90 cpp11 shalimar, the assemblers masm (x86-64) and asm6x (C6000),
              the linkers link (x86-64) and lnk6x (C6000), the vm6747
              emulator, the c2s converter
    bin\lib\  the Shalimar runtime (shmrt-x86_64-windows[-debug].lib) and the
              C6000 runtime (shmrt-tms6747\*.s)
    bin\ti\   ti-build.cmd — the real-silicon TI build path
    include\  cpp11's headers: C++ (<vector>, <new>, <typeinfo>, …) and the
              C ones they wrap, in one directory
    lib\      c90's headers: the C standard headers (<stdio.h>, <string.h>, …)
    settings.json  the installation's settings: where include\ and lib\ are,
              the default compiler (the Tools menu writes it), the assembler
              (bin/masm.exe), the linkers (bin/link.exe, bin/lnk6x.exe),
              "askNative" - whether a failure of ours asks for the vendor's
              tools - and a
              vcvars64.bat when Visual Studio had to be named by hand
              (Tools > Header directories..., Tools > Locate vcvars64.bat...)
    examples\ worked programs and a demo project (demo.pro)
    help\     the full help pages

Include paths and libraries for every compile are in settings.json (Tools >
Include paths..., Tools > Libraries...); a project's own .pro may add its own
`"include": [dirs]` and `"libraries": [files]`, relative to the project. The last three projects opened are at the end of the Project
menu; none is opened on its own at start.

## The full manual

This is the quick reference. The complete manual — the compilation model, every
language feature and non-feature, the project-file architecture, the full
command-line reference, the targets and the native tools, and troubleshooting —
is in `help\manual\` (Part I begins in `01-part1-model.md`), with the full
Shalimar language spec in `help\appendix-a-shalimar-language.md`.
